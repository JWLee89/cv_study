# CV Study

A repository where I practice the fundamentals of computer vision. These notes are
based off my work on the [Computer Vision Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/computer-vision-nanodegree--nd891) from Udacity. 
Note that this is not an affiliate link and I don't receive any compensation from Udacity whatsoever.

The code and comments are purely to help myself and those who are interested
in studying and learning about computer vision.

## Dependencies

The following libraries are required

- numpy
- open cv
- matplotlib

## Experiments

Note that image captioning and object 
detection is performed on the MS-coco dataset 
provided by microsoft. 
To get the example working, we need to first download 
the dataset. There are many working examples online 
(for example, [here](https://mravendi.github.io/2019/06/20/pytorch-coco.html))
